This repository contains a git submodule reference to [jDataView](https://github.com/vjeux/jsDataView), which is released under the [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).

---------------------------------------

The Twofish implementation is based on ["Encryption tool"](http://members.tele3.nl/MAvanEverdingen/Code/code.html) [link now dead], which is "open source" according to the page it was found on.
